### Reflection

Being a new Computer Science graduate from the University of St. Thomas, I have been engaged in several projects that demonstrate my high competence in various areas of programming. Both the theoretical knowledge and practical experience gained during my education have made me capable of addressing existing problems with the help of technology. While studying, I completed several courses and projects related to back-end and front-end development, as well as data management and visualization concepts. Finally, I consider one of the most significant projects I implemented, providing links to the rest, which all reflect my competence and dedication to the learning process. All these projects demonstrate my high technical skills, ability to handle complex tasks, and readiness to join the workforce as a competent and versatile developer.

#### STP_Crime_Database

STP_Crime_Database is a comprehensive tool for crime data management and visualization made in my web dev course. The project’s tech stack is modern: the back end is developed using Node.js and Express, and the front end is created with Vue.js. In addition, this project includes an API with all CRUD operations, which made our work with data quick and efficient.

Crime data is an important concern for every person to understand. With real-time information, users can allocate resources to locations experiencing higher crime rates within specific periods. This project’s design enables immediate insights, enhancing expertise and data-led decision-making, allowing for swift responses. Working on this project boosted my perspective on public safety and crime prevention through data-driven decision-making.

### Additional Projects

#### UST-Book-App

UST-Book-App is a library management system that simplifies the process of book lending in a university library. Developed with Python and SQLite, the app has different login interfaces for students and employees, each with unique features. The application for students enables them to make new orders, while the employee interface handles ongoing orders and support tickets. This project taught me a lot about database utilization and user authentication, emphasizing the importance of security and user-friendly interfaces.
