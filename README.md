### Reflection

As a developer, I have been involved in multiple projects that demonstrate my strong competence in diverse programming areas. I exemplify one of my most crucial projects and then share links to others, which signal my competence and dedication to the studying endeavor.

#### STP_Crime_Database

STP_Crime_Database is a full-fledged tool for crime data management and visualization. The project’s tech stack is modern: the back-end is developed on Node.js and Express, and the front-end is created with Vue.js. In addition, this project started an API with all CRUD operations that made our work with data quick and instant.

Crime data is an important concern for every police department to understand patterns by season or city. With real-time information, authorities can allocate resources to locations experiencing higher crime rates within specific periods. This project’s design enables immediate insights, which enhances expertise and data-led decision-making, allowing for swift responses. Working on this project boosted my perspective on public safety and crime prevention through data-driven decision-making.

### Additional Projects

#### UST-Book-App

UST-Book-App is a library management system that simplifies the process of book lending in a university library. Developed with Python and SQLite, the app has different login interfaces for students and employees, each with unique features. The application for students enables them to make new orders, while the employee interface handles ongoing orders and support tickets. This project taught me a lot about database utilization and user authentication, emphasizing the importance of security and user-friendly interfaces.
